## Kotlin Workshop

![Kotlin Logo](kotlinlogo.png)

A Kotlin workshop intended to be taught in two days. 

### Structure

This workshop is divided into two parts

* Introduction to Kotlin
* Advanced Kotlin

It consists of 

* **Instructor Project**: Used to explain concepts, with existing code samples
* **Student Project**: For students to complete
* **Presentations**: For the instructor to use 
* **Questions**: For students to complete

Both the Instructor Project and the slides have Introduction and Advanced modules included. While the Introduction 
has a lot of pre-built examples, it also serves as a canvas to show more code while teaching. However, please make sure that if you're 
a contributing author to this project, that you *do not* check-in any ad-hoc code. It's also recommended to use Scratch files in IntelliJ IDEA
for this purpose.
